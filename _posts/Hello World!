Hey guys (as in, anyone who managed to find this site), I mostly go by Feli on-line and I welcome you to my little database of strange-and-usual stories!

<!-- more -->

I’ve only really gathered a few, and still need to get them cleaned up before I post them all here. They’re mostly accounts of various folks I know, although I’ve got a set of letters or two!(actually, only one. it just sounds better to say it like that) I’m hosting it on GitHub for now, since it's free. I did pay in the time in too me to set this up - I haven't coded in years, and getting even this humble blog up and running was a genuine challenge. And since I don’t exactly feel like writing it all down by hand, and I’d loathe to use my phone, the internet shall take its place as my personal archive! Don’t expect anything fancy tho, this is for my own database purposes first and foremost, though I don’t mind someone reading. See you once I get the first one formatted!
